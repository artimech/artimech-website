summary: 'How we reduced recommendation latency by 80% and infrastructure costs by 60% through intelligent caching and model distillation.'

Real-time recommendation systems are deceptively complex. What appears as an instant product suggestion to a user involves orchestrating multiple models, data pipelines, and caching layers—all while maintaining sub-100ms response times.

When a major e-commerce client approached us with deteriorating recommendation performance, we discovered their system was buckling under its own sophistication.

## The Challenge

The existing system was processing 50,000 requests per second across 2M+ products, with each recommendation requiring:
- User embedding lookup (20ms)
- Item similarity computation (45ms) 
- Ranking model inference (30ms)
- Business rule filtering (15ms)

Total latency: 110ms average, with p99 exceeding 300ms.

Infrastructure costs had grown to $180k/month, with 80% spent on GPU instances running barely-optimized models.

## The Solution

Rather than throwing more hardware at the problem, we implemented a three-tier optimization strategy:

### 1. Intelligent Caching Architecture

We introduced a hierarchical caching system that exploited recommendation patterns:

```python
# User behavior clustering for cache warming
user_clusters = cluster_users_by_behavior(historical_interactions)
cache_warm_popular_items_by_cluster(user_clusters)

# Real-time cache with smart eviction
@cache_with_ttl(ttl_seconds=300)
def get_recommendations(user_id, context):
    return generate_recommendations(user_id, context)
```

This reduced cold starts by 85% and cut average response time to 65ms.

### 2. Model Distillation Pipeline

We compressed the ensemble of 5 heavyweight models into a single distilled model:

- **Teacher ensemble**: 5 models, 2.3GB total
- **Distilled student**: Single model, 140MB
- **Performance retention**: 97.2% of original accuracy
- **Inference speedup**: 12x faster

The distillation process preserved the ensemble's decision boundaries while dramatically reducing computational overhead.

### 3. Adaptive Batching

Instead of processing requests individually, we implemented dynamic batching that adapts to traffic patterns:

```python
def adaptive_batch_processor():
    batch_size = calculate_optimal_batch_size(current_qps)
    batch = collect_requests(max_size=batch_size, max_wait_ms=10)
    return process_batch_inference(batch)
```

This improved GPU utilization from 23% to 78% while maintaining latency requirements.

## Results

After 6 weeks of implementation and optimization:

- **Latency**: 110ms → 22ms (80% reduction)
- **Infrastructure costs**: $180k/month → $72k/month (60% reduction)
- **Throughput**: 50k RPS → 125k RPS with same hardware
- **Model accuracy**: Maintained 97.2% of original performance

## Key Insights

1. **Profile before optimizing**: Most "performance problems" are actually architectural problems
2. **Cache intelligence matters**: Generic caching helps; behavioral caching transforms
3. **Model complexity ≠ Model quality**: Often simpler models perform just as well in production
4. **Measure what matters**: Latency percentiles tell a different story than averages

The real lesson? Sometimes the best way to scale is to step back and question whether you need to scale at all.
