MLOps bridges the gap between ML experimentation and reliable production systems. For mid-sized businesses, full-scale MLOps tools can be overkill—we focus on practical, implementable practices that deliver immediate value.

## Common MLOps Pain Points

Teams often struggle with:
- **Version control chaos**: Models, data, and code in silos
- **Reproducibility issues**: "It worked on my machine" syndrome
- **Deployment bottlenecks**: Manual processes leading to downtime
- **Monitoring gaps**: Models degrading without notice

A healthcare analytics client had models taking 3 weeks to deploy, with 40% failing in production due to environment mismatches.

## Our Lightweight MLOps Framework

We build scalable MLOps with minimal overhead.

### 1. Version Everything

Unified tracking:

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")

with mlflow.start_run():
    # Log params
    mlflow.log_params({"learning_rate": 0.001, "epochs": 50})
    
    # Train model
    model = train_model()
    
    # Log model
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
    
    # Log data version
    mlflow.log_param("data_version", data_hash)
```

This ensures complete reproducibility.

### 2. CI/CD for ML

Automated pipelines:

```python
# GitHub Actions workflow
name: ML Deployment

on: [push]

jobs:
  test-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
      - name: Build model
        run: python train.py
      - name: Deploy if main
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: python deploy.py
```

Reduces deployment time from days to minutes.

### 3. Production Monitoring

Essential alerts:

```python
import prometheus_client

# Metrics
accuracy_gauge = prometheus_client.Gauge('model_accuracy', 'Model accuracy')
latency_histogram = prometheus_client.Histogram('inference_latency', 'Inference latency')

def monitor_inference(input_data):
    start = time.time()
    prediction = model.predict(input_data)
    latency_histogram.observe(time.time() - start)
    
    # Update accuracy if ground truth available
    if ground_truth:
        accuracy_gauge.set(calculate_accuracy(prediction, ground_truth))
    
    if accuracy_gauge._value < THRESHOLD:
        trigger_alert()
```

Catches issues early.

## Case Study: Fraud Detection System

A fintech company needed reliable ML ops:

- **Before**: Manual deployments, no monitoring, frequent outages
- **Our implementation**:
  1. MLflow for tracking
  2. GitHub Actions for CI/CD
  3. Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring

**Results**:
- Deployment time: 3 weeks → 2 hours
- Uptime: 92% → 99.8%
- Fraud detection improvement: 15% through faster iterations
- Team productivity: +40%

## Implementation Tips

- **Start simple**: Add version control first
- **Tool minimalism**: MLflow + GitHub Actions covers 80% of needs
- **Team buy-in**: Train everyone on the basics
- **Scale gradually**: Add features as pain points emerge

## Why MLOps for Mid-Sized Businesses

It's not about fancy tools—it's about reliable processes that let you focus on business value rather than firefighting.
