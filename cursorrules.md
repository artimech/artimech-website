# Artificial Mechanics Landing Page Plan

## Overall Design Language
Establish an extremely minimal and modern design. Use a monochrome or very limited color palette (e.g., shades of gray, black, white, with a single subtle accent color). Prioritize typography and whitespace. The overall feel should be clean, uncluttered, and give a sense of quiet confidence and high-tech simplicity, appearing 'low effort' but polished.

## Hero Section
Create a full-height or near full-height hero section. It should contain: 
1. **Headline**: A very concise and impactful headline related to AI/ML engineering (e.g., 'Intelligent Engineering.', 'AI, Simplified.', 'Building the Future, Effortlessly.'). Use a large, clean, modern sans-serif font. 
2. **Sub-headline/Brief Description**: One or two sentences describing Artificial Mechanics as an AI/ML Engineering Studio. Keep it direct and jargon-light. 
3. **Call to Action (Optional & Subtle)**: If included, make it a very understated button or text link (e.g., 'Explore Services' or 'Get in Touch'). Avoid flashy or prominent CTAs to maintain the 'low effort' feel.

## Services/Expertise Section
If included, this section should be extremely brief. Instead of a long list, consider: 
1. **Option A (Minimalist List)**: A few keywords or short phrases representing core services (e.g., 'AI Strategy | Model Development | MLOps | Data Engineering'). 
2. **Option B (Conceptual Description)**: A single sentence or two that abstractly describes the type of problems Artificial Mechanics solves or its capabilities. 
 The presentation should be text-focused, with ample spacing. Avoid icons or imagery unless they are extremely abstract and fit the minimal aesthetic.

## Philosophy/Approach Section (Optional)
A short section (2-3 sentences max) that conveys Artificial Mechanics's unique approach. Focus on simplicity, efficiency, and cutting-edge solutions. This is where the 'low effort' (for the client, high expertise from Artificial Mechanics) aspect can be subtly highlighted. For example: 'We believe in elegant solutions to complex problems. Our focus is on delivering impactful AI/ML systems with clarity and precision.'

## Portfolio/Case Studies (Highly Selective & Minimal)
If included, this must be extremely selective. Perhaps showcase one or two key projects with a single sentence description each, or just logos of key clients if applicable. The goal is to hint at capability without overwhelming the visitor. The 'low effort' aesthetic means not trying too hard to impress with a long list.

## Contact/Footer Section
Keep this section very simple. 
1. **Contact Information**: A simple email address (e.g., 'hello@artificialmechanics.com') or a link to a contact form. 
2. **Social Links (Optional & Subtle)**: If present, use small, monochrome icons for relevant professional platforms (e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub). 
3. **Copyright**: 'Â© [Year] Artificial Mechanics. All rights reserved.' 
 The footer should be clean and blend seamlessly with the page.

## Technical Implementation Notes
Use a modern frontend stack. Consider a static site generator for performance and simplicity (e.g., Next.js static export, Astro, or Eleventy) or plain HTML/CSS if the content is truly static. CSS should leverage modern features like CSS Grid/Flexbox for layout. Animations should be minimal and subtle, if any (e.g., gentle fades on scroll or hover). Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes.

## Content Strategy
The language used throughout the site should be concise, direct, and intelligent. Avoid overly technical jargon where possible, or explain it very simply. The tone should be professional yet approachable, aligning with the 'low effort' but high expertise image.
